## About Clip Studio Paint (macOS)
**Clip Studio Paint on MacBook** brings professional-grade illustration, comic, and animation tools to macOS in a streamlined studio environment.

On macOS, **Clip Studio Paint PRO and EX** provide a flexible workflow for single-page illustrations or full multi-page manga/webtoon pipelines. With asset search, downloadable materials, and workspace personalization, your MacBook becomes a portable art workstation that adapts to your style and genre.

The app‚Äôs **3D model support** (poses, props, and cameras) helps you block scenes quickly, maintain proportions, and light complex compositions. Combined with perspective rulers and guides, you can iterate faster while keeping structural accuracy intact.

For animation, **timeline editing, keyframes, and onion-skin** tools make short sequences and animatics approachable on macOS. Export options cover common still and video formats, while color management and resolution controls keep your work publication-ready.
